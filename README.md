1. To write a Dockerfile in the root directory of the project. This file contains instructions for building your Docker image.
2. To create a new repository on GitHub for the project.
To create a .github/workflows/main.yml file in the project repository to define the CI/CD workflow. This file contains the steps for linting, testing, building, pushing, and deploying the Docker image.

3. Code  
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Lint and test code
        run: |
          # Add commands for linting and testing
          # Example: npm run lint && npm test

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t your-image-name .

      - name: Push Docker image to registry
        run: |
          docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }} -p ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
          docker tag your-image-name your-registry-url/your-image-name
          docker push your-registry-url/your-image-name

      - name: Deploy to test environment
        run: |
          # Add commands to deploy the Docker container to your test environment
          # Example: docker-compose up -d

4. To add the Docker registry username and password as secrets in my GitHub repository settings. These secrets will be used to authenticate when pushing the Docker image to the registry.
5. Chosen a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, AWS ECR) to host the Docker images.
6. To set up a test environment (e.g., staging server, cloud service) where my Docker containers can be deployed.



Linting and Testing Code:
- name: Lint and test code
  run: |
    npm run lint
    npm test


Pushing Docker Image to Registry
- name: Push Docker image to registry
  run: |
    docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }} -p ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
    docker tag your-image-name your-registry-url/your-image-name
    docker push your-registry-url/your-image-name

Deploying to Test Environment
- name: Deploy to test environment
  run: |
    docker-compose up -d
